In this section, we will focus on building the IPSec overlay between the remote FortiGate and The "Cloud" FortiGates from the previous chapters.  We will also establish BGP over the IPSec Tunnel.  The end result should be end-to-end connectivity between our remote ubunt server and our "Cloud" ubuntu server.
