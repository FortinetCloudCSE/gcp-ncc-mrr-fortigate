### Prereqs

- Web Browser - You are probably reading this page on your favorite Web Browser.  Feel free to keep using that.  For the qwiklab, you may want to use Firefox or Chrome if you experience issues.  It is **Highly recommended** to use **incognito or private** browswer mode to run the labs.
- Text Editor - While not strictly required, it will probably benefit you to have your favorite text editor up for the purposes of taking notes.  There will also be sections of these instructions where you are required to fill information before pasting code into FortiGate.
- Second Monitor - This is also not strictly required, but it will make moving back and forth between these instructions and the various GUI and console much easier.

### Select Lab

Once you have clicked the Lab icon on your Dashboard, you should see a screen like the one below.  **Click** on the lab.
