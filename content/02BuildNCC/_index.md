### ***Build Hub and Spoke Architecture in GCP NCC- estimated duration 30 min***

The below image reresents part of the environment that was built during bootstrap. In this chapter, students will configure the NCC Hub and a spoke for each FortiGate (fgt1, fgt2).  Students will then configure BGP on the FortiGates in order to exchange routing information with the NCC Cloud Router.
